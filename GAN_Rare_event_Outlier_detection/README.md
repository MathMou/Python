# GAN for rare event outlier detection
This GAN makes of for the relative small number of outliers/targets found in some fraudulent interactions.
It facilitates the use of a very imbalanced dataset as it synthesize new outlier values which is possible to further train on.

This GAN is heavily inspired by the book Machine Learning for Finance: Principles and practice for financial insiders by Jannes Klaas
